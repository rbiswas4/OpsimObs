Weather

A python class to hold site weather data for opsimObs.py.
This class reads the seeing and cloud data from text files.

The cloud and seeing files should have two pieces of information for each record:
  date (in seconds)   seeing or cloud value
  seeing == raw atmospheric seeing in arcseconds at 500nm at zenith.
  cloud == value between 0 to 1 representing amount of cloud extinction
In the default files (prepared from original text files SeeingPachon.txt and CloudTololo.txt),
  the seeing values are sampled every 300s for 2 years (data from Pachon)
  the cloud values are sampled four times per night and are reported in 1/8 increments by observers at CTIO
